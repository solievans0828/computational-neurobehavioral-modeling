# Integrative Behavioral & Dopamine Gene Expression Modeling  
Columbia University | E.E. Just Biomedical Scholars Program  

## Overview

This research project was conducted at Columbia University through the E.E. Just Biomedical Scholars Program. The study integrated mouse behavioral analysis and dopamine gene expression profiling using computational programming methods to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying motor behavior.

The project examined the relationship between behavioral regression and dopamine gene expression decline in Parkinsonian mouse models across a 10-week longitudinal experimental timeline.

Findings demonstrated an inverse relationship between motor function and dopamine gene expression in the substantia nigra, highlighting the genetic regulation of motor behavior.
